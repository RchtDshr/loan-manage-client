Here's a professional and technical README for your loan management project:

# Loan Management System

This project is a **MERN stack** application that allows authenticated users to apply for loans, view their loan statuses, make repayments, and allows admins to approve loans. The system handles loan repayment schedules on a weekly basis and tracks repayments.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and are authenticated using JWT tokens.
- **Loan Application**: Users can apply for a loan by specifying the amount, term (weeks), and start date.
- **Repayment Tracking**: Weekly repayments are automatically calculated. Users can make payments, and if they overpay, the excess is distributed to future weeks.
- **Admin Loan Approval**: Admins can approve loans, and only approved loans are visible to users.
- **Loan Repayment Status**: Users can track loan statuses (e.g., `PENDING`, `PAID`), and make repayments until fully paid.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Express.js)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <url>
   cd loan-management-system
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (refer to [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   By default, the backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend (React.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
